// An Introduction to JavaScript Syntax
// Your first function: the console log
// Console is the function then the period is like accessing a sub folder
console.log('You can write anything here to the console!');
// Another function the console has:
console.warn('Uh oh! I am a warning!');
// And another...
console.error('Error! Error! I am an error!');

// Storing data in variables. Think of a variable like a box that can contain a specific type of data
// NOTE! var is bad - don't use it. This is for demonstrative purposes only, and it's important to know it exists.
// Inside this variable is a string
var yourName = 'Franz Kafka';
// Log it to the console
console.log(yourName);
