# Ultimate Fullstack

An educational repo containing supplementary notes to help you learn fullstack development.

## Why did you create this repo?

From August 2021 to February 2022, I attended a fullstack web development bootcamp in a part-time capacity. While attending this bootcamp, I was working full-time as a QA Specialist in tech. Due to my working hours, I found it very difficult to keep up with module projects, module assessments, and group projects.

I began working as a fullstack developer in April 2022. I quickly came to realise that my bootcamp had skimmed over a lot of the fundamentals of coding, rushed through modules without adequate explanation or put the onus on the student to read other resources that could be found on the internet for free.
